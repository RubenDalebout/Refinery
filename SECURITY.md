## Security Best Practices

To ensure the security of your Minecraft server and plugins, we recommend following these best practices:

- **Dependency Management:** Always depend on the Refinery plugin when integrating it into your own plugins. This ensures that your plugin uses the latest version of Refinery, including any security fixes or updates.

- **Regular Updates:** Keep your Minecraft server and all plugins up to date with the latest releases. Developers frequently release updates to address security vulnerabilities and improve overall stability.

- **Access Control:** Limit access to administrative commands and features to trusted users only. Implementing proper access controls can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functionality.

- **Secure Configuration:** Configure your server and plugins securely by following best practices for permissions, configuration files, and server settings. Avoid using default or insecure configurations that may expose your server to security risks.

- **Monitoring and Logging:** Monitor your server logs for unusual activity and security events. Logging can help you detect and respond to potential security threats in a timely manner.

If you discover a vulnerability, please allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the issue before disclosing it publicly.
